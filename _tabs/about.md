Hi! I am Jou-An(Joanne) Chen. Software Engineer with 3+ years of hands-on working experience in software product development. MS student in Information Systems with a concentration in Connective Media at Cornell Tech. Actively seeking 2024 software engineer summer internship. Holding a BSc in Computer Science and a BBA in Business Administration, from National Taiwan University. 

My career path began with NextBank, a startup local online bank in Taiwan, and then transferred to work for ShopBack. ShopBack is the largest cash rewards platform in the Asia Pacific, and I worked as a full-stacked engineer in ShopBack browser extension team for two and a half years. I used to code in Node.js and Python, with some C++. I am passionate about software architecture and software test automation. I am open to learning new tech stacks and programming languages.
